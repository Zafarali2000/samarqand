   <h3>Name of historical monument: Mirzo Ulugbek observatory</h3>
   <p>Was it possible to predict that the great scientist of the 15th century, the grandson of Amir Temur, Ulugbek (1394-1449), many works and researches for many centuries will have a significant impact on the development of world science? The achievements of the Ulugbek School of Astronomy had a great impact on the development of the exact sciences of the West and the East, India and China. In 1428-1429, Ulugbek built one of the largest medieval observatories in the world in Samarkand. The plan of the observatory is a circular three-story building with a cave-like depth, containing a marble quadrant with a diameter of 46.4 m and a height of at least 30 m. Major astronomers, students of Ulugbek, Ali-Kushchi and Qazizada ar-Rumi worked in the Ulugbek observatory.

      <div class="content"><p>Mirzo Ulugbek Observatory, also known as Ulugbek Observatory, is an important historical monument located in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. It was built in the 15th century by the astronomer and ruler Mirzo Ulugbek, who was the grandson of Temur (Tamerlan), the conqueror of Central Asia.
          <br><b>Below is some important information about Mirzo Ulugbek Observatory:</b>
         <b> Location: </b>The observatory is located 3 kilometers northeast of the historical center of Samarkand, famous for its architectural and cultural heritage, on a hill known as Kuhak.
       </p>

          <p><b>Construction:</b> The observatory was built in 1424-1429 and was one of the most advanced observatories of its time. It consisted of a large cylindrical instrument called a sextant, used for astronomical observations. <br>
          <b> Purpose: </b> Mirzo Ulugbek's main purpose in building the observatory was to compile precise astronomical tables. He and his team carried out extensive observations of celestial bodies, as a result of which a comprehensive astronomical catalog, "Zij-i-Sultaniy", containing the location of more than a thousand stars, was compiled.</p>
          <p><b> Architecture: </b> The observatory's sextant was an impressive structure, about 30 meters (98 ft) long. It had a finely crafted marble arc with a radius of 40.4 meters (133 feet), which allowed for precise measurements of the celestial bodies.<br>
          <b>Intermission and rediscovery:</b> After the death of Mirzo Ulugbek in 1449, the observatory was abandoned. The structure was largely destroyed in the 17th century, and only as a result of large-scale archaeological excavations at the beginning of the 20th century, its remains were discovered. <br>Today, the Mirzo Ulugbek Observatory is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List and attracts those interested in the history of astronomy and architectural achievements of the Timurid period. There is a museum on the site with works, exhibits and information about Mirzo Ulugbek's contribution to astronomy.</p>

             <p>Among the many astronomical studies conducted by Ulugbek in this observatory, the priceless work entitled "Zizhi Koragoniy - Table of Stars" consisting of 1018 star descriptions is of great interest. The length of a sidereal year was defined by Ulugbek as 365 days, 6 hours, 10 minutes, 8 seconds. It is surprising that the observations of astronomers from Samarkand were carried out without optical instruments, only with an ordinary eye. According to the research of scientists, there were other instruments in the observatory, which, unfortunately, have not been preserved.

             <p> The first star chart in the history of astronomy was compiled by the ancient great astronomer Hipparchus, who lived in the II century BC. The table of this scientist contains the coordinates of about a thousand stars; it appears in the famous ancient Greek scientist Ptolemy's "Almagest" (the full title of this treatise is "The Great Mathematical Construction of Astronomy in 13 Books"), dating from about 140 AD. The Hipparchus Star Chart is also known as the Hipparchus-Ptolemy Catalogue. Research conducted at the Ulugbek Observatory is the first complete re-observation of the stars 16 centuries after the creation of the Hipparchus-Ptolemy Catalogue. Ulugbek's chart contains almost the same stars as Ptolemy's, but its coordinates are given with higher accuracy. In fact, Ulugbek was the second astronomer (after Hipparchus) to compile the main table of stars (based on his own observations).

          <p> It takes a lot of effort and years of hard work to create a star chart. The star chart is very valuable for science. They provide an understanding of the distribution of light rays in the sky in different periods. They are the material for studying the movements of celestial bodies. Ulugbek's star table became known to European astronomers after its publication in 1648 - in this year, the main work created in Ulugbek's Samarkand observatory was first partially published. The work was prepared for publication and commented by John Greaves (1602-1652), professor of astronomy at Oxford University. Later, parts of the table were published several times in England.

      <p>17 years after the first Oxford edition, English orientalist and translator Thomas Hyde (1636-1703), learned keeper of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, "Tabulae Long, as Lat. Stellarum Fixarum, ex observatione Ulugh BeighiÂ», Oxonii, 1665, prepared and published a new edition of Samarkand catalog in Persian and Latin languages. The most detailed analysis of Ulugh Beg's catalog of stars, based on the study of 8 manuscripts stored in British libraries, was published in 1917 in the USA by E. B. Knoble, "Ulugh Beg's Catalog of Stars. Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain" was published. The main instrument of the Samarkand observatory is a marble wall quadrant with an arc radius of 40.2 m and an arc length of 63 m. Most of this huge angular instrument is underground, under the observatory - located at a depth of more than 10 meters. The second half of the quadrant is located in a rectangular tower that rises 28 meters above the ground and has not been preserved to this day.

           <p>This quadrant, located in the direction from south to north, that is, in the plane of the meridian, was used to determine the heights of the Sun, Moon and planets above the horizon during the passage of the celestial meridian, as well as to measure the angular distance between stars and to observe bright stars. The large size of the scale is very made it possible to make observations with high accuracy, in particular, the coordinates of the Sun could be determined with an error of only 1 arcsecond. Minutes and seconds of arc are counted on an auxiliary scale. Along the marble walls of the scale, brick steps were built that led to the depths of the hill.

             <p>Time was cruel to this unique monument of science. The Ulugbek observatory gradually fell into disrepair and was divided into bricks at the end of the 17th century. In 1908 and 1914, the Russian and Samarkand scientist V.L. The site of the observatory and a part of the main instrument were identified in the excavations conducted in the Samarkand region under the leadership of Vyatkin. But these excavations did not give the expected results. The find turned out to be the remains of the outer wall of a huge three-story building. Researches of the observatory were carried out in 1941 by academician M.E. Masson, in 1948 V.A. Successfully continued by Shishkin.</p>
