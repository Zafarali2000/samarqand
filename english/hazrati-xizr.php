      <h3>Name of historical monument: Hazrat Khizr Mosque</h3>
          <p>Hazrati Khizr Mosque is an architectural monument in Samarkand (mid-19th century) associated with the legendary immortal person Hazrat Khizr. The building is located on the hill opposite the Shahizinda complex, built on the foundation of the mosque (1855 according to the inscription on the altar). The mosque consists of a room, 2 adjacent rooms, additional rooms, a storehouse, a minaret, and later an additional porch (1899) and a gatehouse (1919) were built. At the beginning, a steep staircase leads to the gatehouse, and a small room is entered.

          <p>One of the most sacred places of pilgrimage and architectural monuments of our city, the first Muslim mosque of Samarkand is the Prophet Hazrat Khizr Mosque. If you look around from the front of the mosque, you can see a landscape that merges with the horizon. The entire body of the magnificent Amir Temur Jame Mosque and Bibikhanim Mausoleum can be seen. A little further away, the famous Registon Madrasahs, with their minarets and domes, stand out. Below, the magnificent domes of the Shahi Zinda mausoleum and the series of mosques offer a magnificent view.

             <p>Until now, there were speculations that there are hidden graves under the empty land in the middle of the river. When this place was excavated, it became clear that there is no hidden grave here. Also, the members of the expedition found that the mausoleum was built on the cultural layer of the XI-XII centuries. In June 1941, archaeologists led by Ya. Fulomov opened and studied the graves in the mausoleum. It should be said that those buried in this mausoleum were buried in stone coffins made of marble stones. These stone coffins were initially placed under the mausoleum, that is, in the saghana, and after the roof of the saghana fell, the stone coffins were placed inside the shelves.

             <p>A lot can be said about the influence of Khizr in the Muslim world. This prophet may have been one of those who were cherished by the Most High.
             Historian Abu Tahirkhoja's book "Samaria" mentions the characteristics and qualities of mosques and madrassas of this city in the chapter: "The mosque of Hazrat Khizr alayhissalam. Outside the city, it is on the hill of Afrosiyab, Ohanin, in other words, opposite the gate of His Majesty the King. They say that this is the first mosque built in Samarkand. Imam Qutaiba was built under the direction of Hazrat Khizr. Another narration was restored by the Companions. According to some people, Hazrat Khizr fixed its mihrab. They say that if you spend the morning prayer in that mosque on the 40th Monday, you will see Hazrat Khizr (a.s.). This mosque was rebuilt during the reign of Amir Muzaffar Khan.

           <p>In the 7th century, the Arab caliphate conquered the city of Samarkand and destroyed all the fire worshipers' places of worship in the city, but for some reason they kept the Hazrat Khizr mosque and even improved this place. From ancient times, the prophet Khizr was considered an "immortal person", and he was the guardian of underground mines, wealth and water, and Muslims.
According to the narrations, when strangers beheaded Shahi Zinda (Qusam ibn Abbas), Hazrat Khizr came to his aid and took Qusam ibn Abbas to the paradise of the underpass and gave him "life". Qusam ibn Abbas is resurrected and sits on the throne of the Garden of Paradise under Samarkand together with Khizr alayhissalam and Prophet Daniel.

             <p>Belief in Hazrat Khizr, peace be upon him, was high, and the renovation of his mosque continued. In Samarkand even in the 18th century, despite the scarcity and high prices, the people of Samarkand started their pilgrimage from Hazrat Khizr Mosque. The Prophet Daniel, Qusam ibn Abbas and Hazrat Khizr mosques were connected at the same time. It is said in the foundational book of Muhammad Ali Parvanichi (19th century) that during a severe drought in Samarkand, the worshiping campaigns of Allah were held in Hazrat Khizr and Shahi Zinda. The date 1239 Hijri (1823-1824) was written on the seal of the foundation document. It can be seen from this document that the mosque was functioning at that time. The date 1854 indicated on the marble stone at the entrance of the mosque confirms that it was only the date of renovation./p>
