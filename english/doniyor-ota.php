      <h3>Name of historical monument: Shrine of Father Daniel</h3>
          <p>Khoja Daniyor's mausoleum is one of the most prestigious and famous shrines in Samarkand. Daniyor, Daniil, Daniel is the name of a saint in Muslim, Christian and Jewish literature. Father Daniel was born in Jerusalem in 603 BC and belongs to the descendants of King David and Solomon (Solomon). A part of the burial ground of Daniel was brought to Samarkand in compliance with established regulations. The mausoleum has the longest grave in the world - 18 meters. The mausoleum building was built at the beginning of the 20th century. Until then, there is information about the tomb of Khoja Daniyor and a mosque here.

          <p>According to the interpretation of the Bible, Daniel means "God the Judge" in Hebrew. Daniel was born in Jerusalem in 603 BC and belongs to the descendants of King David and Solomon. Er. avv. In 586, after the conquest of Israel by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, Daniel was taken to Babylon (Iraq) with the children of other nobles. They study different subjects. Daniel was considered one of the most talented young people. He showed the strength of his religious beliefs, abstained from drinking wine and oil, and ate only vegetables and followed religious rules. That's why his wisdom and religious piety are described as a reward from Allah according to the interpretation of the Bible.

          <p>There is no information about this event in the records of the biographers of Amir Temur. Some historians say that the Persian historian Istahri came to Movarounnahr four hundred years before the birth of Timur, and writes that the tomb of Hazrat Daniel existed in the city at that time. According to the reliable sources of some researchers, the religious community of Jews who existed before the Islamic religion brought to Samarkand the holy stone of Hazrat Daniyor. , local fire worshipers respected these believers and allowed to build a temple on the outskirts of the city. </p>

         <p>As confirmation of this, the cultural remains around the mausoleum were excavated by archaeologists. It belongs to the VII-VI centuries, and according to the Bible, it corresponds to the time when the prophet Daniel lived. Christians could also bring the prophet's hoe to Samarkand, because it is known that during the Byzantine ruler Zeno's time, a part of Daniel's hoe was moved to Constantinople (now Istanbul).

             <p> And finally, there is an opinion that the ashes of Qusam ibn Abbas, the son of Daniel, the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad, are actually buried in the mausoleum. Samarkand historian Abu Tahirkhoja writes in his book Samaria: "Khoja Daniyor's grave is located on the outskirts of Samarkand, under the northern wall of the Afrosiyab fortress. Siyob river flows near the mausoleum. People consider this grave as the grave of Prophet Daniel, but his grave is in Mosul region. It is said that this grave is the grave of one of Qusam ibn Abbas' comrades. God bless you! The grave is covered with the stones of Zarafshan. They say that Khoja Daniyor was very pious and pious. On the head side of the grave, near the Siyob stream, there is a spring of Khoja Daniyor. People drink and bathe in it. It is considered to be the reason for the healing of many sick people. May God have mercy on that person!"

          <p>Another Central Asian source tells us about the services of the Prophet Daniel - this is Binai's book "Dream Interpretation". In this case, many wise words begin with the word "Daniyor, peace be upon him." A 500-year-old pistachio tree still grows on the northern side of the mausoleum. Inside the mausoleum, we see the longest tomb in the world, it is 18 meters long. The height of the grave is 90 cm on the south side, 160 cm on the north side, slightly wider - 2 m on the north side, because a square sagona was installed on this side. The sagona is made of baked bricks, sandblasted and decorated with marble panels with Quranic inscriptions.

      <div class="content">
      <p>On the opposite side of the saghona, on the window sill of the mausoleum facing the north, there is a small stone with Arabic inscriptions called "niyat-toshi" by the locals. Pilgrims circle the tomb of Hazrat Daniel one or three times and try to lift or at least move this stone. There are several traditions about the length of the grave. According to one of them, because the brought turbat was considered sacred, people with bad intentions could dig up the remains and take them away. Therefore, a long grave was dug and the remains of the Prophet were buried somewhere in it.

           <p>Many repairs have been done in the mausoleum. The shrine was surrounded by a wall and a 3-part staircase was built to reach the shrine. At the same time, the tomb was covered with onyx and black marble. An early 20th century photograph shows the mausoleum as having six domes, but today it has five domes, which may have been destroyed and rebuilt. On the north side of the mausoleum, the upper part of the building is decorated with domes made of baked bricks. They are built in European style. In the interior, shield-shaped anchors and arches supporting the domes were used in that period.
