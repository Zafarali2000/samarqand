          <p>Bibikhanim's mausoleum was very luxurious and majestic at the time of its construction, its walls were decorated with colorful tiles, patterns, and inscriptions with verses from the Qur'an. The interior structure of the mausoleum, like the Gori Amir mausoleum, was two-story, with a hall below and a shrine on top. After the collapse of the dome of the mausoleum, snow and rain fell into it, and the roof of the saghana collapsed. In 1941, scientists under the leadership of archaeologist Yahya Fulomov conducted excavations in the mausoleum and discovered many things that were unknown until now.

             <p>Until now, there were speculations that there are hidden graves under the empty land in the middle of the river. When this place was excavated, it became clear that there is no hidden grave here. Also, the members of the expedition found that the mausoleum was built on the cultural layer of the XI-XII centuries. In June 1941, archaeologists led by Ya. Fulomov opened and studied the graves in the mausoleum. It should be said that those buried in this mausoleum were buried in stone coffins made of marble stones. These stone coffins were initially placed under the mausoleum, that is, in the saghana, and after the roof of the saghana fell, the stone coffins were placed inside the shelves.

             <p> Archaeologists first began to open the stone coffin standing on the northern shelf. When the stone lid covering the stone coffin was lifted, bones mixed with cotton and gauze were seen inside. According to anthropologist M. Gerasimov, these bones belong to a 25-30-year-old woman. Since there were no inscriptions on the lid of the stone coffin, it was not possible to determine the identity of the princess. After that, scientists began to open the second stone coffin placed on the northern shelf. The length of this coffin is 1 m 90 cm, width 47-66 cm, height 37 cm, and it was also made of gray marble. When the lid of the stone coffin was opened, the remains of bones, soil, cotton and gauze were seen in a mixed arrangement.

          <p> The bones inside the coffin were crushed to such an extent that it was impossible to determine its age, only anthropologist M. Gerasimov found that these bones belonged to an old woman. After that, they began to open the stone coffins on the eastern shelf of the mausoleum. Here, three stone coffins were placed next to each other, and they were also prepared by cutting the inside of solid marble stones. Two of the three stone coffins on the eastern shelf were empty, and only one had a body inside.

          <p>Archaeologist M. Ye. Masson, who studied the architectural monuments of Samarkand, told archaeologist Ya. Fulomov that the stone coffins in Bibikhanim's mausoleum were first opened in 1871 after the conquest of Samarkand by the Russian Empire. However, even M.Ye.Masson did not know the purpose of opening the coffins. Stone coffins were opened for the second time in 1926 by a group of thieves. Thieves broke into the coffins and stole jewelry and other ornaments from the deceased. Because of this, when the mausoleum was opened for the third time in 1941, the bones inside it were lying upside down.
