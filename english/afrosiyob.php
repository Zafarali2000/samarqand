          <p>Afrosiyob Castle, also known as Afrasiyob or Afrasyab, is an ancient archaeological site located in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. It is of great historical and cultural importance, as it was once the ancient city of Samarkand, the capital of the Sogdian Empire. <br><b>Some important points about Afrosiab Castle:</b>
         <b> History:</b> Afrosiyab dates back to the 6th century BC, it was founded as an important Sogdian city. It flourished as a major cultural and commercial center along the Great Silk Road. However, the city was destroyed by the forces of Alexander the Great in 329 BC. It was later rebuilt and continued to flourish until it was abandoned and fell into ruins in the 13th century.
       </p>

          <p><b>Archaeological excavations:</b> Extensive archaeological excavations have been carried out since the 19th century. As a result of these excavations, many artifacts, including pottery, coins, jewelry, and frescoes, were found, providing valuable information about the ancient Sogdian civilization. <br>
          <b>Order and structures:</b> The ancient city occupied a large area of about 1.5 square kilometers. It was surrounded by defensive walls and had several monumental structures, including palaces, administrative buildings, temples and residences. The remains of the Afrasiyob palace, from which this place got its name, have been partially reconstructed. </p>
          <p><b> Wall Paintings: </b> One of the most remarkable discoveries in Afrosiab is a series of wall paintings found in the ruins of ancient buildings. These vivid frescoes depict scenes of everyday life as well as mythological and religious motifs. Some of the surviving frescoes can be seen in the nearby Afrosiyob Museum. <br>
          <b> Afrosiyob Museum: </b> Adjacent to the archaeological site, the Afrosiyob Museum houses a collection of artifacts and exhibits that reflect the region's rich history. The museum provides a deeper understanding of Sogdian culture and exhibits archaeological findings from excavations in Afrosiab.</p>

         <p>Interest in Afro-Siab and its findings began in 1868 after Tsarist Russia conquered Samarkand. Major Borzenkov (1874), lieutenant colonel V. V. Krestovsky (1883), orientalists N. I. Veselovsky (1884-85, 1895), V. V. Barthold (1904) and V. L. Vyatkin (1905; 1912-13) were engaged in preliminary excavations in Afrosiyab. In 1919, M. YE. Masson, V. L. Vyatkin, continuing his excavations in the places where he had begun his research, discovered the ruins of the Samonite palace (9th century). In 1925, 1929-30, V. L. Vyatkin continued excavations in Afrosiyab and collected a lot of materials related to its history in different periods.

             <p> But the archaeological excavations carried out in Afrosiyab until the 1930s gave very little information about the history of ancient Samarkand. After the war, Afrosiyob I. Terenozhkin, one of the scientists of the Institute of History and Archeology of the FA of Uzbekistan, conducted serious field research in Afrosiyob. As a result, in its lowest layer, objects belonging to the 6th-5th centuries BC and house ruins were found. V. Afrosyob Shishkin (1958-66) and Ya. As a result of large-scale archeological excavations conducted under the leadership of F. Gulomov (1967-70), materials of the ancient cultural layer were found in other places of Afrosiyab. On July 13, 1966, a special decision of the government of the Republic was adopted in order to organize a comprehensive archaeological study of Afrosiab. According to him, Afrosiyob was declared an "archaeological reserve", and Tashkent and Samarkand state universities and the Institute of Art Studies of the Ministry of Culture were mobilized to study it. Thanks to archeological research, which was started on the basis of precise scientific plans, not only the centuries-old age of the city, but also its historical topography of different periods, the structure of the city, the stages of development of city life, and the period of crises caused by invasions were determined.

      <p>Archaeological materials found in Afrosiab show that Samarkand was established as the central city of Sugdiyona in 8-5 BC. Mil. av. In 329, the city was destroyed by the troops of Alexander the Great, traces of which are still well preserved in the city's defense structures. Mil. av. In the 3rd and 1st centuries, during the reign of the Kushans, there was a rise in the life of the city. Mil. av. In the 3rd century, the city was surrounded by a double defensive wall. According to archaeological materials and written sources, the Great Silk Road passed through Samarkand during this period, domestic and foreign trade and handicrafts flourished.

          <p>From the second quarter of the 9th century, the power in Movarounnahr passed into the hands of the Somanites. Bukhara became their center. During this period, Samarkand developed rapidly economically and culturally. Palaces, rich peasant houses, mosques and madrasahs, baths and sewers, and stone streets decorated with carved ganch patterns are found in Afrosiyab. Due to the difficulty of supplying the city with water, in order to meet the needs of the population, a canal was dug by Dargom in the first years of the city's life. Traces of this canal were opened and studied in the place where the statue of Alisher Navoi stands on the south side of the current city avenue. This canal goes through Registan Square towards Hazrat Khizr Mosque. According to historical sources, at the entrance to Afrosiyab from the south, an arched brick arch was built over the moat of the city, and a large ditch was passed over it. This stream was called "Juyi arziz" ("Lead Stream"). Here the stream divides into three parts and goes through the city to the Siyob stream.
          </p>
          <p>At the end of the 10th century, when the power in Movarounnahr passed into the hands of the Karakhanids, trade, crafts, and urban improvement continued in Samarkand. The craftsman image of the city grew stronger, and the mansions of noble peasants were now centered outside the city, in their courtyards. In 1220, Genghis Khan's troops destroyed the "Juyi Arziz" dam and left the city without water. The defenders of the city surrendered in an unequal battle. The invaders destroyed the walls and gates of the city and set fire to palaces, mosques, madrasas, and residents' houses. A large part of the population was killed in the battle, the artisans were driven to Mongolia. The last defenders of the city hid in the Jome Mosque and continued their resistance. Their charred bodies came to us in battle clothes and were found during archeological excavations. "Lead Ditch" was not restored. The inhabitants of Afrosiyab, who were left without water, made a living by extracting water from Siyob in a bucket, and then gradually the inhabitants abandoned Ani completely. Ancient Samarkand, which turned into a desolate ruin, was previously called "Hisori kohna", "Kal'ai Hisar", and from the 17th century it was called "Kal'ai Afrosiyob" or "Afrosiyob" among the inhabitants.

The results of the joint research of Uzbek and French scientists clarified a number of issues related to the ancient history of Samarkand, i.e., the remains of an even older wall built of mud were discovered under the city defense walls dating back to the 6th-5th centuries BC, proving that the age of Samarkand dates back to the middle of the 8th century BC. The remains of the magnificent palace of Samarkand in the shape of a murabba (70x70) dating back to the 8th century AD were discovered in the arch part of the city. Archaeological research is ongoing in Afrosiyab.
