          <p>The Shahizinda ensemble, which was named "Pearl of Samarkand", is not only a historical-architectural monument, but also the eternal resting place of famous scholars, saints, queens, and military leaders. Despite the fact that each mausoleum here is covered with unique decorations, they all form a single composition, a complete architectural work. Another valuable aspect of Shahizinda is that almost three thousand years of Samarkand's history is embodied here. After all, the area where the Shahizinda ensemble is located belongs to the southern regions of Afrosyab, and if this land is excavated, archaeological materials from the 6th-1st centuries BC will be found.

          <p> According to historians, the formation of the Shahizinda ensemble began in the 11th century AD. The meaning of the word Shahizinda is "living king", and this name has been living among the people for over a thousand years. According to the writings of Muslim historians, it is a title given to Qusam ibn Abbas, the living king-cousin of our Prophet Muhammad. According to Samarkand historian Abul Hakimi, Qusam ibn Abbas was the last person to see the blessed faces of our Prophet. According to Muslim historians, Qusam ibn Abbas came to Samarkand as part of the Arab army in the 8th century and was engaged in spreading the religion of Islam. One day Qusam ibn Abbas was engaged in prayer when he was attacked by infidels and took his severed head in his hands and fell down through the cave.

      <div class="content"><p>After Amir Temur sat on the throne of Samarkand, great changes took place in the life of the Shahizinda ensemble. Amir Timur built a new one in place of many of the ruined structures here, repaired many of them, and installed a luxurious tombstone on the grave of Qusam ibn Abbas. Also, by order of the owner, a new mosque was built here. At this point, we must say that the architectural ensemble of Shahizin is a complex monument consisting of mausoleums, mosques and madrasas built by various rulers and officials in different periods.

      <p>For this reason, it is difficult for tourists who visit this place to understand and understand it easily. To make it easier for tourists, we decided to talk about the orderly constructions and mausoleums, starting from the gate of Shahizinda ensemble. Tourists heading to the east side of the Siyab farmer's market will notice the blue domes that stretch out on the slopes of Afrosiyab. Tourists who want to visit Shahizinda step on the steps and enter through the gate. On the front of this gate there is an inscription: "This magnificent building was built by Abdulaziz Bahadir ibn Ulughbek Kuragon, ibn Shahrukh, ibn Amir Temur Kuragon in 838 (1434-35)." According to historians, this gate and gate was built by Mirza Ulugbek himself, but he wrote it not in his name, but in the name of his younger son Abdulaziz. Tourists entering the gate turn left to the mosque built in the 19th century, and turn right to the small madrasa built by Davlat Qushbegi in 1813. On the opposite side of the madrasa is a summer mosque built by Master Sadiq in 1910. Tourists who have passed through these structures go up through the stairs made of bricks.

             <p>This greenhouse, covered with wonderful and elegant decorations, will attract your attention with its elegance. On the opposite side of the mausoleum of Shirinbeka, there is a mausoleum containing the graves of Shodimulk and his mother, who died early. It is recorded that this mausoleum was built by the architects Usta Bahriddin and Usta Shamsiddin from Samarkand and Zayniddin from Bukhara. According to historical sources, Shodimulk died in 1371, and his mother Turkon died in 1383. Tourists passing by these mausoleums will encounter two unknown mausoleums standing side by side on the left side of the road. Only one of them preserves the name of the master who created it, that is, Ali Nasafi.

      <p> Tourists slowly walking through the corridor in the middle of the Shahizinda ensemble now approach the highest point. The oldest part of the ensemble is located here. Amir Burunduk, the bravest commander of Amir Temur, is sleeping here forever. His mausoleum was built around 1380. Tourists who have visited the grave of Amir Burunduq, now turn to the right side of the corridor and enter the Qusam ibn Abbas mausoleum. The tombstone of Qusam ibn Abbas is very luxurious, all three stones are covered with elegant majolica and verses from the Qur'an are written on them. There is also a well-preserved shrine, a shrine and a mosque built in the 15th century. Several mausoleums, a mosque and a shrine were built in Shahizinda at the very end of the corridor in Ansanbli. According to historians, the mosque, shrine and mausoleum here were built by Amir Temur's wife, Tuman Agha, and this pious princess herself is sleeping here forever. On the opposite side of the mausoleum of Tuman Aga, the tomb of the princess, whose identity is unknown, but who died in her youth, is probably preserved. At the very end of the corridor is the mausoleum of Ulama Khoja Ahmad, which is the last building. Of course, it is not possible to give complete information about the Shahizinda ensemble here. It is known that the construction of this ensemble began during the Karakhanid period, developed during the period of Amir Temur and Timurids, and was completed during the Mangit period. we think it's better to see it once. Dear tourist, listen to the silence here by stepping gently on the steps of Shahizinda. In this sacred soil, the great people of Great Turan will be forever remembered.
