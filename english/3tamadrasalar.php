      <p>Tilakori madrasa is one of the important historical structures located in Samarkand city.
          <b> Information about Tillakori Madrasah:</b>
         <b> Architecture: </b> Tillakori madrasa was built in the 17th century during the reign of Timurid ruler and astronomer Ulugbek. It is part of a larger complex called Registan Square, which consists of three madrassas. The architectural style of the Tillakori madrasa follows traditional Timurid design, with intricate tiling, intricate patterns and blue domes.
       </p>

       <p><b>Features: </b> The main facade of the madrasa faces the Registan square and has a grand entrance portal decorated with ornate tiles and calligraphy. The outer walls are decorated with colorful glazed tiles and geometric patterns. Inside the madrasa is a large courtyard surrounded by student rooms, classrooms and prayer rooms. The main attraction of Tillakori madrasa is the elegant mosque with high dome and mehrab. <br>
          <b>Decorative elements: </b> The interior walls of the Tillakori madrasa are covered with intricate patterns and decorative paintings made of gold leaf. Intricate patterns and calligraphy in blue, gold and turquoise create a stunning visual effect. The Madrasah is especially famous for its skillful use of jewelry and gold leaf, giving it a unique and bright look.</p>
          <p><b> Current Use:</b> Although Tillakori Madrasa was originally built as an Islamic studies institution, it is no longer an active madrasa. Today, the complex serves primarily as a tourist destination and a venue for cultural events, exhibitions, and craft markets.

         <p>Initially it was called "Nalangtoshbi Small Madrasa". Later, because the amount of gold used in the decoration of the mosque was sufficient for the construction of another monument, it was called "tillakori" (worked with gold). T.m. was used as a city mosque and Madrasa. That is why the mosque (63x22 m) is large and luxurious, it is different from other madrasahs. Madrasah (70x70 m) is entered through the western porch. The pediment has a deep arch, the front of the 2 wings are arched, 2-story rooms, the corners are occupied by flower mezzanines of equal size.

         <p> The plinth of the mosque room (10.8x10.8 m) is high and visible from afar. Its dome was not completed. A marble mihrab and a minbar with steps were made in the hall. In its time, two sides of the hall, attractively decorated with gilded patterns, were occupied by porches (corridors) with arched fronts and dome roofs. It is written on the marble slab in the porch of the peshtoq that the decorative works were completed in 1659-60. During the restoration of the peshtoq, which was damaged by the earthquake, by the order of Haidar, its shape was distorted. During the renovation in 1885, the gilding patterns were replaced with ordinary paints. Samarkand repair workshop was established in T.m. research work was carried out to find the color. The masters scientifically studied and restored rare gilded patterns in T.m. that were about to disappear (1970). The builders reconstructed the facade of the madrasa facing Registon, aligning it with the Sherdor Madrasa and the Ulugbek Madrasa. The peshtoq arch and the shield-shaped arch inside the arch, the flower bouquet and the khanakah dome, and the relief patterns with golden relief inside were re-polished (1974). A dome covered with turquoise tiles was installed on top of the high dome.

      <p> The richness of decorative themes in the style of the head, the richness of the internal and external patterns, the decorations reminiscent of Iraqi embroidery on the wing and shelf of the pediment, relief inscriptions are unique. Tilers used different methods to fill the corners and decorative corners (the small patterns of the bricks were adapted to the geometrical and Islamic patterns of the tiles). Tiled arches feature green beads, yellow leaves, and turquoise stems.

The yard area (50x50 m) is covered with marble. The surrounding rooms have doors and fences. The rooms are cool even on summer days. A museum was established in T.m., where things related to the repair of the madrasa were stored.

<p>It is a prominent historical monument located in the city of Samarkand, Uzbekistan.
    <b>Some information about Sherdar Madrasah:</b>
   <b> Architecture: </b> Sherdar madrasa was built in the beginning of the 17th century, during the rule of the Shaibani dynasty. It is one of the three madrasahs that make up Registan Square. The architectural style of the Sherdor Madrasah combines Islamic and Central Asian influences, with intricate tiling, vibrant colors and geometric patterns.
</p>

    <p><b>Features: </b> The most remarkable aspect of the Sherdar madrasa is its magnificent facade, which features a large mosaic of lions. These lions are rare in Islamic art, as depictions of living creatures are often avoided. The image of two lions chasing the sun is said to symbolize the legendary story of the struggle between good and evil <br>
    <b> Decorative elements: </b> The outer walls of the madrasah are decorated with vibrant blue, turquoise and white glazed tiles, creating intricate patterns and geometric patterns. The main entrance portal is decorated with calligraphy and ceramic tiles. The dome and minarets of the madrasah are also beautifully decorated.</p>
    <p><b> Interior: </b> The interior of the Sherdar madrasa consists of a central courtyard surrounded by student rooms, classrooms and a mosque. The prayer hall showcases intricate decorative elements including intricately carved wooden columns, ornate ceilings and colorful tile work<br>
    <b> Current use:</b> Like other madrasas in Registan square, Sherdar Madrasah is not an active educational institution. Now it is primarily a tourist attraction, offering visitors the opportunity to explore its magnificent architecture, learn about its historical significance, and appreciate intricate craftsmanship. The Sherdor Madrasah is an important part of Samarkand's architectural heritage, attracting tourists from around the world.

<div class="content">
       <p>The design is made in the traditional style of Central Asia, and the main appearance is impressive with an arched entrance door with a pointed end. Initially, it was planned to name the building in honor of the governor Yalangtosh Bahadir. However, people called it "Sherdar", which means "place of lions". The madrasa got its modern name because of the unique decoration on the front tympanum, the scene of a snow leopard hunting a white gazelle under the rays of the rising sun is depicted on the basis of the image of fantastic animals.
       </p>
      
   </div>


   
   <div class="content">
   
   <p> Although, according to Muslim traditions, it is forbidden to depict animals or people in holy places, this madrasa is an exception. It is necessary to master them. The human face warns the god, depicting the appearance of a symbolic figure: "Even if you are a beast, you must not forget that you are not immortal." For almost three centuries, Sherdar was considered the most famous educational institution among Muslims

<div class="content">
<p>The process depicted on the facade of the madrasa over time has become one of the national symbols of Uzbekistan. The dimensions of the Sherdar madrasa and the opposite Ulugbek madrasa are practically the same. According to the architect, the buildings should be mirror images of each other, and a special "kosh" technique was used here.

<div class="content">
<p>However, over time, the relief of this place has changed a little, so Sherdor is located a little lower than the Ulugbek Madrasah. The decoration of the building is decorated with Kufic inscriptions, words of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and holy words from the Holy Quran.

   <div class="content">
   <p>Madrasa was built in 1417-1420. Artistically, it was not inferior to the buildings built by Timur, and at the same time, it was far superior to them in terms of strength. Initially, the madrasa consisted of 50 rooms, and more than a hundred students studied in it a year. According to historians, Ulugbek himself taught at the madrasa. Famous Persian poet Jami lived and created here. Jami's listeners included Sheikh Khoja Ahrar Vali, one of the most famous representatives of the Naqshbandi sect, and the great poet Alisher Navoi.

   <p> The building had 2 floors, there were four high domes above the corner classrooms, and four minarets in the corners. The huge gable, which occupies two-thirds of the main facade, faces the square with a huge and deep spear-shaped arch. In the 18th century, the madrasah suffered a lot of damage due to internal conflicts. The rooms on the second floor and the outer domes were destroyed. 20- at the beginning of the century, the main part of the renovation of the madrasa was carried out by the architects and artists of that time.
