    <p>Among the rarest exhibits of the museum, the wall paintings decorating the walls of the VII century palace lobby found in 1965 in the central hall, a few hundred meters west of the museum building, occupy a special place. It was the seat of the Varkhuman family, which ruled Samarkand in the third quarter of the 7th century. Four compositional plots are depicted on the four walls - the reception of ambassadors by the ruler of Samarkand, the solemn visit to the mausoleum, the hunting of ilvirs, etc.

<p>The murals presented in the central hall of the Afrosiab Museum were considered rare works of art of their time and used to decorate the guest waiting rooms. They accidentally uncovered a wall buried in the ground during the construction of the Tashkent road, later these murals were moved to the central room of the museum by special methods and exhibited since 1985. After archeological excavations, it was found that this place belonged to the hotel of a high-class person. More precisely, this is the guest room of King Varkhuman, who ruled in the third half of the 7th century.
