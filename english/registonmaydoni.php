      <p>17 years after the first Oxford edition, English orientalist and translator Thomas Hyde (1636-1703), learned keeper of the Bodleian Library in Oxford, "Tabulae Long, as Lat. Stellarum Fixarum, ex observatione Ulugh BeighiÂ», Oxonii, 1665, prepared and published a new edition of Samarkand catalog in Persian and Latin languages. The most detailed analysis of Ulugh Beg's catalog of stars, based on the study of 8 manuscripts stored in British libraries, was published in 1917 in the USA by E. B. Knoble, "Ulugh Beg's Catalog of Stars. Revised from all Persian Manuscripts Existing in Great Britain" was published. The main instrument of the Samarkand observatory is a marble wall quadrant with an arc radius of 40.2 m and an arc length of 63 m. Most of this huge angular instrument is underground, under the observatory - located at a depth of more than 10 meters. The second half of the quadrant is located in a rectangular tower that rises 28 meters above the ground and has not been preserved to this day.
